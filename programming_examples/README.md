# Programming Examples

The first purpose of this section is to demonstrate the pseudo-neocortex architecture features. The second purpose is to demonstrate how the pseudo-neocortex architecture can be used to solve problems first in the embedded space and in other areas of programming. The examples are organized as follows:


## 1. Column Element Return Codes
This section illustrates the basic return codes of column elements and how they are used to control the flow of execution. Refer to the code in the following section:
[Column Element Return Codes](./column_element_return_codes/README.md)

## 2. Control of an Action Implementing a Complex Sequence of Steps
This section illustrates how a complex sequence of steps can be implemented using the neocortex architecture. Refer to the code in the following section:
[Sequence Control](./sequence_control/README.md)

## 3. Pseudo Neocortex Columns Controlling Other Pseudo Neocortex Columns
This section illustrates how one column can control other columns. Refer to the code in the following section:
[Column Control](./column_control/README.md)

## 4. Implementation of Simple and Complex State Machines
This section illustrates how both simple and complex state machines can be implemented using the neocortex architecture. Examples are included to show how to implement sequences and state machines within a single architecture. Refer to the code in the following section:
[State Machine](./state_machine/README.md)

## 5. Implementation of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Actions
This section illustrates how to implement RPC actions. Refer to the code in the following section:
[RPC Actions](./rpc_actions/README.md)

## 6. Implementation of Data Flow Type Architecture
This section illustrates how to implement a data flow type architecture. Refer to the code in the following section:
[Data Flow](./data_flow/README.md)

## 7. Implementation of Common PLC Control Functions
This section illustrates how to implement common PLC control functions. Refer to the code in the following section:
[PLC Control Functions](./plc_control_functions/README.md)

## 8. Implementation of Transactional Control
This section illustrates how to implement transactional control. Refer to the code in the following section:
[Transactional Control](./transactional_control/README.md)

## 9. Other Examples
Other examples will be added as they are developed (TBD).
